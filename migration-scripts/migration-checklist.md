## Important Notes

### üîê **Security Considerations**
- Change all default passwords
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys where possible
- Enable MFA on AWS root account
- Regularly rotate access keys
- Monitor AWS CloudTrail logs

### üí∞ **Cost Considerations**
- RDS instances can be expensive - use t3.micro for development
- CloudFront has free tier limits
- S3 charges for storage and requests
- Set up billing alerts to avoid surprises

### üîÑ **Backup Strategy**
- RDS automated backups enabled
- S3 versioning enabled for important buckets
- Regular exports of database
- Configuration backups in version control

### üìä **Performance Optimization**
- Enable CloudFront compression
- Use WebP images where possible
- Minify CSS/JS files
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Use CDN for static assets

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Database Connection Issues**
- Check security group rules
- Verify RDS endpoint URL
- Ensure SSL connections enabled
- Check credentials in Secrets Manager

### **CloudFront Not Updating**
- Create invalidation for changed files
- Wait for distribution deployment
- Check cache-control headers
- Clear browser cache

### **WAF Blocking Legitimate Traffic**
- Review WAF logs in CloudWatch
- Adjust rate limiting rules
- Whitelist known good IPs
- Check geographic restrictions

### **High AWS Costs**
- Review AWS Cost Explorer
- Check for unused resources
- Optimize database instance size
- Implement S3 lifecycle policies
