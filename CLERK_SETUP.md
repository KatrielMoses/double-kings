## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your Clerk Account

1. Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Click "Get started for free"
3. Sign up with your email or GitHub
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create Your Application

1. In your Clerk dashboard, click "Create Application"
2. Name your application (e.g., "Double Kings Fitness")
3. Choose your sign-in options:
   - **Email** ‚úÖ (recommended)
   - **Google** ‚úÖ (recommended)
   - **Phone** (optional)
   - Others as needed
4. Click "Create Application"

### Step 3: Get Your Keys

1. In your application dashboard, go to **"API Keys"**
2. You'll see two important values:
   - **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
   - **Frontend API URL** (something like `clerk.your-app.com`)

### Step 4: Update Your Configuration

1. Open `js/clerk-config.js` in your code editor
2. Replace `'pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE'` with your actual **Publishable Key**
3. Replace `'YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL'` with your actual **Frontend API URL**

**Example:**
```javascript
publishableKey: 'pk_test_abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456',
frontendApi: 'clerk.amazing-fitness-app-12.clerk.accounts.dev',
```

### Step 5: Update the HTML Script Tag

1. Open `index.html` in your code editor
2. Find the Clerk script tag (around line 21)
3. Update both the `data-clerk-publishable-key` and `src` attributes:

**Before:**
```html
<script
    data-clerk-publishable-key="pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE"
    src="https://YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL/npm/@clerk/clerk-js@latest/dist/clerk.browser.js">
</script>
```

**After:**
```html
<script
    data-clerk-publishable-key="pk_test_abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456"
    src="https://clerk.amazing-fitness-app-12.clerk.accounts.dev/npm/@clerk/clerk-js@latest/dist/clerk.browser.js">
</script>
```

### Step 6: Test Your Setup

1. Open your website in a browser
2. Open the browser console (F12)
3. Look for the success message: "üöÄ Clerk authentication initialized successfully"
4. Click the "Sign Up" button to test

## üé® Customization

The authentication components are already styled to match your dark theme with red accents. The configuration in `js/clerk-config.js` includes:

- **Dark theme** with your exact color scheme
- **Red primary color** (#e74c3c) matching your brand
- **Custom fonts** using Poppins (your current font)
- **Blur effects** and modern styling
- **Mobile responsive** design

### Changing Colors

To change the color scheme, edit the `variables` section in `js/clerk-config.js`:

```javascript
variables: {
    colorPrimary: '#your-new-color',        // Main brand color
    colorBackground: '#your-bg-color',      // Background color
    // ... other colors
}
```

### Changing Behavior

You can customize where users go after signing in/up by editing:

```javascript
signIn: {
    afterSignInUrl: '/dashboard',  // Where to go after sign in
},
signUp: {
    afterSignUpUrl: '/welcome',    // Where to go after sign up
}
```

## üîê User Management

### Accessing User Data

Once a user is signed in, you can access their information anywhere in your JavaScript:

```javascript
// Check if user is signed in
if (Clerk.user) {
    console.log('User email:', Clerk.user.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress);
    console.log('User name:', Clerk.user.firstName + ' ' + Clerk.user.lastName);
    console.log('User ID:', Clerk.user.id);
}
```

### Protecting Pages

To protect pages (like workout-logger.html), add this to the top of your JavaScript:

```javascript
// Redirect to sign-in if not authenticated
if (!Clerk.user) {
    Clerk.redirectToSignIn();
}
```

### User Profile Management

Clerk automatically provides a user button with:
- **Profile management** - Users can update their info
- **Security settings** - Change password, add 2FA
- **Sign out** - Clean session termination
